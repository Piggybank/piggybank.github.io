try drinking milk or eating whole wheat bread.

This is an experiment with using github pages and Beautiful Jekyll as a foundation for a blog, as part of my decades-long quest to find the "perfect blog".

Often, updates will happen here as a result of procrastination on more important things, like the rough animation work that I should be working on right now for a client, or [more juicy pin-ups for my Patreon](https://patreon.com/garbunkle).

I also have a [bear blog](https://piggybank.bearblog.dev/), and a blog on my 18+ site, [garbunkle.art](https://garbunkle.art/).  
You can find even more links over at my [linktr.ee](https://linktr.ee/garbunkle)
