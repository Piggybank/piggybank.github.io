*You are seeing with your eyes the very first issue of **OC Origins**, a new original series detailing the origin stories of my characters.  Only because I like to type a lot of stuff and talk about myself!  Wow!!*

While I say these are all original characters of my own, Mitri isn't technically made under my pen, but instead was an adoptable design purchased and inherited from the talented RedBlooper back in 2013.  Known originally as just "Sweater Girl", she carried a magnifying glass and looked to be very sneaky.

I really liked her immediately charming design and thought there was a lot of potential to create some fun stuff with her, so I picked her up.  The name Mitri ultimately came from a song in Paul Kowalewski's portfolio album called "Mitri's Bike".  I just liked the name Mitri a lot.

Initial ideas for what to do with the character bounced back and forth from a comic to a detective game made in Construct 2, but things began to fizzle quickly.  I had never inherited a design from someone else quite like this before, so ideas didn't come together like I had thought they would.  Along with that, I could never quite get a handle on her personality or how to draw her back then, and others who I asked for advice at the time didn't know what to do with her either.

For a while, it honestly felt like I had stumbled with purchasing her.  By the time 2014 rolled along, I put her aside and figured an opportunity to give her the spotlight might present itself someday.

## 2018 - The Emerl Reboot & the future

In 2018 I attempted to reboot *Emerl*, first as a webcomic and later as an animatic.  Narwood (the sleepy Appellation town in which Emerl and all of the characters lived in) became a home for many of my characters who couldn't find a place of their own to call home, and Mitri was one of many who fit that bill.  
She would have become an active resident of the town, and was more of a tomboy who liked to get into a little bit of trouble every now and then.

However, as the webcomic and animatic project began to fizzle when newer, stronger ideas cropped up, Mitri spun off into her own path.  I found that I was more capable of drawing her at that point, or at least drawing her in a way that still kept a lot of the spirit of her original design, and ideas began to coalesce.

She even got a short comic at one point based around her princess design called *Princess Mitri*:

As she gets closer to her tenth anniversary in 2023, she's become a regular subject for commissions and the occasional pin-up or cheesecake drawing.  They're fun things to create, but I still hope she can someday find footing in something substantial which truly establishes her character in a fun way.
