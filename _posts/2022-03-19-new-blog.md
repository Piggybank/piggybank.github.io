![Old Website Banner](/assets/img/websiteBanner_2011.jpg)
###### *- Banner used in 2010 for Livestream, the first live streaming service I had used.  From left to right: Mark, Flops, Emerl, Jumble, May, Frank... and I can't remember the monkey's name lol*

My first "website" was a small section of a family website called *Kalmar World*, which my father ran for a time in 2005 thru 2009.  Each member of my family had a section of the website to call home, and I had called mine "*Nick's Seaside Nook*".  I recall it mostly consisted of Sonic sprite comics, with maybe also a game I made in Game Maker called *Piggy Panic* (which is also where my username Piggybank came from).

It was a pretty dorky site, but it was also unmistakably *me*.  I'm sure that I wouldn't have made it any other way.

In 2011 I rebooted the idea as my first tumblr blog, and had also called it *Nick's Seaside Nook*.  The name stuck around as I started to find my identity as an artist with my other tumblr blogs and YouTube channel exploding in popularity around it, until the title was eventually dropped and replaced with only my name, the blog now having become a dedicated "art blog".  In recent years, the blog has undergone another name change to now share the "*MarkandFlops*" title my other sites now use, and it will probably be the last name change the site goes through.

It became difficult to break away from exclusively posting art as my portfolio grew and more people found out about my work, each coming in with different expectations for what they wanted to see from my work.  Not that I paid it much attention, but I can't say that I didn't hear it at all, either.

While I like to think my work can be a form of expression for myself, not every drawing can succeed at getting everything off my chest.  A private journal was a solution for a time, and while it was therapeutic, I still yearned for a proper avenue to publicly share some of those thoughts that came together better than expected.  And as more UGC sites seem to be struggling to cope with the herculean load placed upon their shoulders, I also wanted a website that I could once again truly *own*.

And so, as a bit of an experiment with both Github Pages and to see how much merit a new website has in a world where everyone's currently congregating on only three, I've brought back the Seaside Nook once more.

It's quiet here.  There's only the sea, the water, the birds, the wind, the swaying grass...  
and you, who has found this message in a bottle.
