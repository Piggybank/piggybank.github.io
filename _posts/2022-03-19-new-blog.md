My first website was a small section of a family website called "Kalmarworld", which my father ran for a time in 2005 thru 2009.  Each member of my family had a section of the website to call home, and mine was called "Nick's Seaside Nook".  It mostly consisted of games I had made in Game Maker and Sonic sprite comics.  It was pretty dorky, but also unmistakably *me*.  I wouldn't have made it any other way.

In 2011 I rebooted the idea as my first tumblr blog, and also called it Nick's Seaside Nook.  The name stuck around as I started to find my identity with my other tumblr blogs and YouTube channel exploding in popularity, until the title was eventually dropped from the blog and replaced with just... my name.  A blog that I originally used for posting whatever I wanted had slowly become a dedicated "art blog".  It became difficult to break away from that as my portfolio grew and more people found out about my work, each coming in with different expectations.

While I like to think my work and drawings can be a form of expression for myself, not every drawing can succeed at getting everything off my chest.  A private journal was a solution for a time, and while it was therapeutic, I still yearned for a proper avenue to share some of those thoughts that came together better than expected.  And as more UGC sites seem to be struggling to cope with the herculean load placed upon their shoulders, I also yearned for a website that I could once again truly *own*.

And so, as a bit of an experiment with both Github Pages and to see how much merit a new website has in a world where everyone's currently congregating on only three, I've brought back the Seaside Nook once more.

It's quiet here.  There's only the sea, the water, the birds, the wind... and you.

You're the one who found this message in a bottle.
